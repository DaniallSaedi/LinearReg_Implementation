# Linear Regression From Scratch (NumPy)
    
A lightweight and educational implementation of **Linear Regression using Gradient Descent**, written entirely with NumPy.  
This project is ideal for learning how linear regression works under the hood — without relying on scikit-learn.

---

## Features
    
- Gradient Descent optimization  
- Optional feature scaling  
- Optional L2 regularization (Ridge)  
- Early stopping based on gradient norm  
- Tracks loss history  
- Clean and simple API (`fit`, `predict`)
