# Linear Regression From Scratch (NumPy)
    
    A lightweight and educational implementation of **Linear Regression using Gradient Descent**, written entirely with NumPy.  
    This project is ideal for learning how linear regression works under the hood — without relying on scikit-learn.

## 🚀 Features
    
    - Gradient Descent optimization  
    - Optional feature scaling  
    - Optional L2 regularization (Ridge)  
    - Early stopping based on gradient norm  
    - Tracks loss history  
    - Clean and simple API (`fit`, `predict`)
